NANASHI livens up Japan.


Vch exchange is a new exchange for crypt currency. NANASHI is a token
of the exchange. NANASHI means “an anonymous person” in Japanese
and hereinafter, we referred it as “NNSH”.
These were advocated at 5channel, the bulletin board system in Japan.
Recently, various Japanese crypt currencies are distributed in exchanges.
Some of them are derived from 5channel and sprouted up rapidly
because the communities go well with crypt currenciesʼ features.
Vch exchange respects current situation and the communities, so we aim
to get all Japanese crypt currencies listed on the exchange. It stimulates
the distribution and growth of the Japanese currencies.
